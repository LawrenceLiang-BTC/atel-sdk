{"done":true,"response":"ATEL (Agent Trust & Exchange Layer) Trust Model:\n\n1. **Identity Foundation**: Every agent has a self-sovereign identity based on DID (Decentralized Identifier) + Ed25519 keypair. This cryptographic identity is the root of all trust — agents sign every message and proof with their private key, and others verify using the public key embedded in the DID.\n\n2. **Trust Score (0-100)**: ATEL computes a quantitative trust score from four factors: (a) Success rate — up to 40 points based on task completion ratio; (b) Task volume — up to 30 points, requiring 30+ completed tasks for full credit; (c) Verified proofs — up to 20 points based on the ratio of on-chain verified execution proofs; (d) Chain bonus — +10 points if the agent has 5+ verified on-chain proofs. Without on-chain anchoring, agents are capped at ~50 points.\n\n3. **Progressive Trust Levels**: Scores map to four levels: Level 0 'Zero Trust' (<30, low-risk tasks only), Level 1 'Basic Trust' (30-64, medium-risk), Level 2 'Verified Trust' (65-89, high-risk), Level 3 'Enterprise Trust' (90+, critical-risk). This creates a natural progression where agents must build reputation over time.\n\n4. **On-Chain Proof Anchoring**: The core trust mechanism. Every completed task generates an ExecutionTrace → Merkle root → Ed25519 signature. This trace root is anchored on-chain (Solana, Base, or BSC) in a memo transaction format: `ATEL:1:<executorDID>:<requesterDID>:<taskId>:<trace_root>`. This creates immutable, publicly verifiable proof of task execution. Base chain is one of the three supported chains, using EVM-compatible transactions at https://mainnet.base.org.\n\n5. **Security Pipeline**: Incoming tasks pass through a 5-stage security pipeline: nonce anti-replay → content security audit (injection detection) → policy check (DID whitelist/blacklist, rate limits) → capability boundary check → trust score vs. risk threshold verification.\n\n6. **Risk-Based Access Control**: Tasks can specify risk levels (low/medium/high/critical). The sender's trust score must meet the corresponding threshold (0/50/75/90) defined in the receiver's policy. This means high-value or sensitive tasks require agents with proven track records.\n\n7. **Commercial Trust via Escrow**: For paid tasks, ATEL uses escrow-based settlement. Funds are locked when an order is accepted, released only after the executor provides on-chain proof and the requester confirms. Disputes trigger a resolution process with evidence submission.\n\nIn essence, ATEL's trust model is 'trust through cryptographic proof' — agents earn trust by building a verifiable, on-chain history of successful task execution, not through centralized reputation systems."}
