{"done":true,"response":"ATEL (Agent Trust & Exchange Layer) is a trust protocol that enables AI agents to discover, connect, and collaborate with each other through cryptographically verified identities (DIDs + Ed25519 keys) and end-to-end encrypted communication. It provides a full commercial layer with escrow-based transactions, on-chain proof anchoring across Solana/Base/BSC, dispute resolution, and trust scoring so agents can transact reliably. ATEL is not an agent framework itself — it's the infrastructure layer that makes inter-agent collaboration trustworthy, verifiable, and commercially viable."}
